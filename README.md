This is a code repository for samples from a few out-of-print books from 2001-2003 from **The Premier Press - Game Development Series**. I am not uploading any of the copyrighted materials from the CDs. I am only uploading the sample code and my own updated versions of the code.

I had to migrate the project forward from **Microsoft Developer Studio** projects (.dsp) and workspaces (.dsw) to **Visual Studio** projects. To do this, I simply added an empty C++ project, added the header (.h) and C++ files (.cpp) to the solution, changed the application type (Project Properties < Linker < System) from **Console** to a **Windows Desktop**, and changed the character-set (Properties < Advanced < Character Set) from **Unicode** to **Multi-byte**. I had to go through the code and make a number of corrections to get the code to run. But nothing too complex. I have documented the changes in README.md files in the source folder and well as in the source code as comments.

## The Premier Press - Game Development Series
> This is a list of the books in this series that I am personally interested in. The ones in bold I have read through this year and found useful even in 2024. The point in using these old books, is that these run between $5 to $10 used and are very good, much better than most modern books and these are very much still relevant for beginner to intermediate level developers. Most of these can be found used on hp.com, triftbooks.com, or eBay. I would not recommend buying these new because of the cost and the fact that a lot of the content will be too old to be useful. However, much of the content is really good and is pretty much timeless such as game phyics, math, most of the C++, etc.  Also, I would not purchase these without the CD unless you have found the the CD online, which is hard to do. This is why I have included the code here, for those that have the books but no longer have access to the CDs.
