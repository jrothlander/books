This is a code repository for samples from a few out-of-print books from 2001-2003 from **Premier Press - Game Development Series**. 

To work with the samples in Visual Studio 2022, I had to migrate the project forward from **Microsoft Developer Studio** projects (.dsp) and workspaces (.dsw) to **Visual Studio** projects. To do this, I simply added an empty C++ project, added the sample header (.h) and C++ files (.cpp) to the solution, changed the application type from **console** to a **Windows desktop**, and changed the character-set from **unicode** to **multi-byte**. I have saved the project files in the project folders and I left the .dsp and .dsw files there as well. 

I have added a number of README.md files to various folders to explains some of the details I ran into while working through the samples.
