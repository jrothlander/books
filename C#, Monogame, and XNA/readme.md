I have been doing a sort of deep dive into game development the past few years, and have decided to focus on Monogame and XNA. I wanted to work through some advanced concepts, 
books, tutorials, etc. and apply the techniques to Monogame and C#. I thought it would be interesting to approach a number of classic C++ game development books, but then 
rewrite the code in C# and using the Monogame framework. That is what these repositories are, my approach to some of the older classic game dev books and rewriting the code in 
C# and Monogame.
