I created this from scratch based on the original book demo as an example. This was written in C# using the MonoGame framework. If you are not familiar with MonoGame, it is intended to be a replacement of Microsoft's XNA Framework. You can read about it at MonoGame.org.

I've approach this as simply and logically as possible, but there are dozens of things that can eb improved on. The intent is just to demostrate the design of the path finder app for those that as familiar with C++ or those wanting to approach it from C#. 

If you have any thoughts, suggestions, etc. and would like to reach out, feel free to do sohere or at j.rothlander@att.net.
