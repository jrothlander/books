I worked through all of the original demos in C++ and I am going back and rewriting them in C# as I have time. I have completed the the chapter-1 demo for the path-finder app, and I am working on the traveling salesman demo from chapter-2. I will post it as soon as I complete it. 

I will probably skip over a couple of the demos that that have improvements in later chapters, and just build the final versions. Those demos are a bit more complex and will take some time to work through. But I plan to do so.
