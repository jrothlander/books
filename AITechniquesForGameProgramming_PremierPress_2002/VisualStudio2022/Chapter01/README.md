I prefixed the chapter title with section numbers to get them to sort correctly. But other than that, I didn't change anything else here.

I did find it interesting that if you use Visual Studio 2022 and create a new Windows desktop app, the code is almost identical to the code being demostrated here in chapter 1. It has not really changed in over 20+ years. I think the author did a great job explaining how the code works, and he did it much better than a few C++ books published in 2024 that I have recently read. The difference is probably the writing ability of the author.
