This project was created in Visual Studion 2022 (v143), Windows 10, and C++ 14 Standard. 

I created each project from scratch and copy the code over from the original and adjusted it as necessary to get it to work. I had issues with the the resoure files and had to build them from scratch, using the resource .rc files from the original as a blueprint. I may not have implemented them 100% the same, as I left of things like the author's name on the About dialogs that actually serve no purpose. But I have implemented the same functionality. The point being, anyone that wants to go through the text and is new to C++ and doesn't want to run into any issues with the original source that is now over 22-years old, you can use this solution, open it in Visual Studio, and it contains all of the projets, code, resource, etc. are available and working without any compiler or runtime errors.
