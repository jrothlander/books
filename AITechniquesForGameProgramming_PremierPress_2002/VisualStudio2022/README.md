These projects were created in Visual Studion 2022 (v143), Windows 10, and C++ 14 Standard. 

I created each project from scratch and copied the code over from the original and adjusted it as necessary to get it to work. 

I had issues with the the resoure files and had to build them from scratch, using the resource .rc files from the original as a blueprint. I may not have implemented them 100% the same, as I left of things that serve no real valuee. The point is that anyone that wants to go through the text and is new to C++ and doesn't want to run into any issues with the original source that is now over 22-years old, as you this soure to start from. The projects should work without any compiler or runtime errors. 

Once I finish working through them all, I will upload a solution with all of the projects.
