**Chapter 2** gets a little more complicated, as the author is going over adding resources to C++ desktop applications. If you are not familar with this, then this is a pretty good introduction. But you may find it easier to go through a more modern tutorial online. 

I don't recommend you try to copy over the original code for this chapter, but use my copy in this folder, as the resource format seems to have changed in the past 20+ years. I was unable to use the original resource files for the menu, icons, etc. and I could figure out why that was. They look the same but Visual Studio didn't like them. 

I wasn't able to get the menus from the original code to work for me in **Visual Studio 2022**. However, I felt like if I knew a few tricks with working in C++ and Visual Studio I could have. The problems I had were simply with Visual Studio automatically doing this for me that I did not want it to do. Therefore, I ended up just building the menus from scratch and using the original source as a blueprint. I did end up having to make a few tweaks to the code because of this. But all in all, the code functions exactly the same as the original.
