**Chapter 2** gets a little more complicated, as the author is going over adding resources to C++ desktop applications. If you are not familar with the setup of Windows desktop applications in C++, this is an excellent introduction. 

I don't recommend you use the original C++ code for this chapter, but use version in this folder, as the resource format seems to have changed in the past 20+ years. I was unable to use the original resource files for the menu, icons, etc. and I could not figure out why that was. They look exactly the same, but Visual Studio didn't like them for some reason. I must have missed something somwhere. 

I wasn't able to get the menus from the original code to work for me in **Visual Studio 2022**. However, I felt like if I knew a few tricks with working in C++ and Visual Studio I could have. The problems I had were simply with Visual Studio automatically doing things for me that I did not want it to do. Therefore, I ended up building the menus from scratch and using the original source as a blueprint. I did make a few tweaks to the code to get it to work with my version of the menus, mostly just adjustments to the names. But all in all, the code functions exactly the same as the original.
