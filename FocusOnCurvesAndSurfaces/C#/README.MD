Pierre Bezier (1910-1999) was a French engineer, professor, and author. He spent 42 years at Renault and published and patented 
techniques on modeling geometric curves and surfaces, which are used today in computer aided design and 3D modeling. Wikipedia 
has a short bio on him. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_curve

I really good primer on Bezier curves cn be found at: https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/

My approach is to working through the book with a focus on game development, C#, and Monogame. Using this book as a guide, I want 
to step through an introduction to a few of these curves and how to calculate and implement them in our games. From here, you can 
dig into the details as much as you wish and depending on your own interests and needs.
