;v3 doesn't contain a normal vector, it contains the
;vectors that determine how the billboard is scaled.
;Multiply this vector by the scaling factor defined by c7.
mul r2, v3, c7

;Use the scaled expansion vector in r2 to expand the vectex
;in the correct up and side directions. The result is 
;stored in r1

;This instruction is specific to this example. It moves the
;vertex slightly closer to the eye by sliding it aLong the eye
;vector. This ensures that the light flare is always in front
;of the light fixture, but not in front of the lamp post itself.
;This is not really needed for general billboarding, but a similar
;technique might be useful for other specific applications.

;and texture coordinates.
